KNOWN ISSUES

	-	whenever a Wikitude view which makes use of trackers for image recognition
		purposes gets destroyed, the process could suddenly crash
	-	whenever a Wikitude view temporarily loses focus, some resources should to 
		be released, in order to reduce computation, memory and power consumption
	-	ARchitect world resources must be put into the module assets folder in order
		to let the application load them properly
